            	About The Girl
            </h2>
       		<p>
            	Kim Vroman is a current student at Michigan State University, going to school to receive Creative Advertising and Media & Information degrees. She also studied to receieve a Specialization in Design. Kim is originally from Trenton, Michigan, and the many art classes she took in high school are where she really found her passion for design. She has interests in everything art and design related, but her true love lies with photography, painting, and typography.
            </p>
            <h2>
            	Likes And Dislikes
            </h2>
            <p>
				Aside from art and design, Kim really enjoys playing video games in her spare time. She currently plays on the Xbox 360, where she owns over 30 games. However, she is greatly looking forward to saving enough money to buy a PS4. Sorry Microsoft! She says it's nothing personal.<br><br>
        		Kim also loves watching movies and television shows, and keeping up with relevant pop culture. All while enjoying a nice pizza and Coke. And even though she's terrible at them, Kim likes to play soccer and ultimate frisbee when it's nice outside.<br><br>
                Kim really hates being stuck somewhere with a dead cellphone, she's come to rely on it way too much. She's also not a huge fan of the horror genre.       
            </p>
			<h2>
            	Future Plans
            </h2>
            <p>
				After she graduates, Kim plans to pursue a career in web and graphic design. Owning her own company or just starting a small business is where she wants to ultimately end up.
